an airship 

there is a video game that you played twice
 
the first time it was an easy win 

and you got to live in this elaborate mansion

during a bonus level 

the second time the game was much harder to win

you had to run go get some quarters to put back into the machine

you thought you had run out of time to continue the game 

the game featured a hulking action hero type monster with a crew cut and muscles 

a little boy comes up wanting to play and you give a quarter to help you

the dreams last night 

more people maybe susan 

old freinds from scad 

the muscluar fellow with the hair lip that was slow 
and good hearted 

some kind of potion

traveling through a city 

dreaming like mad
