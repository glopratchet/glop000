now for a story about alligators 

something fierce 

and with teeth 

something about being in a swamp surrounded by alligators 
as you mind wonders to 

you think about an old love 

you think about how your hands must always move 

you thing about the crazy stuff you used to wonder about 

you use to love 

you use to dance
