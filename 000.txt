Maybe we could go as far as to say art is supposed to make you feel something

either through its beauty, criticism, fantasy or whatever

I personally was brought up to believe art is supposed to move you
to make you feel or think something you haven't before. 

A new outlook that, 
 
 if not for art, you would not have.

 We are using the measurements of other media to castrate videogames. 
 
 We are using the past to describe games today, 
 and by doing that we are cutting off what games can be.

 ok then let us just imagine 
you have a screen 

the game has to be advanced by a person
that is the first rule of fight club

a click 

a click is all you need to advance 

how does one redeem the cornovirus pandamic screen

somebody has got to sit there and click 

then the simulation can move forward 

the lady complained about how there are elitest who just come up with ideas all day long
and that it is a fantasy to think you can get into these circles 

so what 

what is it to her

gator earth 

those that can 

and those than cannot 

so you advance time 
then what

all the characters would would act 

then the results would bubble up to the main screen 

but then the whole thing would need to head some where 

well then the name of the show is gator earth 

so there must be something about how ugly something is at the base of the soul

The "vagaries of an MMO where unpredictable player behavior is the rule," 

is the reason for doing it. 

Our films were never intended for a passive audience. 

We wanted our audience to have to work, 
to have to think, 

to have to actually participate in order to enjoy them

This may be because while we enjoy movies, 

Gaming engages your mind actively whereas most genre films 
(the films we tend to watch) 

are designed to provoke as little thinking as possible. 

Those are the people, 
the people who thought about it, who worked at it, 

who we ultimately made the trilogy for and it now makes perfect sense 

to us that they should inherit the storyline

For us, the idea of watching our baby evolve inside 

the virtual bubble-world of this new radically developing medium

which has in our opinion the potential of combining the best attributes of films and games

of synthesizing reality TV with soap opera, RPGs and [Mortal Kombat], 

is fantastically exciting.

vagaries of an MMO where unpredictable player behavior is the rule

that is the key take away 

how can you make the expierence novel 

to not just the audience 

but to yourself 

the suprise would need to come from the rules 

rule number one

rule number two 

rule number three

what does it look like 

what does it sound like 

what happens

where do you start
