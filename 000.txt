In the World to come there is little sin. 

There are just lots of American Alligators. 

After the election of the first ungendered President, the prediatrain movement caught fire in America.

The demand for American Alligator meat skyrocketed

Whorals where burned to ash while Polled Hereford Heifors fetched over a billion dollars a head in auction

Googizon won the bid to construct for the military the most forward thinking alligator farm in existance

It currently floats near the Okeenokee Snow Swamp.

This is not that story.

We are Primal Ponds Inc.

A small mom and pop alligator farm attemping to make it.

We need you to make deliveries for us.

Please...

Point of View of the Player:

A delivery champion 

he had a secert life as billy fea fbots 

And one more thing...

It turns out no one has made a crappy real time virtual reality game 

dedicated to delivering dragon tail in the far, far, future. 

Maybe that needs to change

We proudly introduce today

Alligator Delivery Service. 

The Alligator Farm where the gator are delivered is currently under a series of construction tasks. 

Already we own over four over ten foot alligators including Rex Lex, 

a massive 14 foot beast. 

Each on is incredibly detailed with over twenty bioligocail parts. 

We are currently broadcasting their vital signs over at americanalligator.xyz 

Our alligators come in many different sizes, ages, shapes, sexes and shades. 

The like to eat, sleep, dream, and spawn but they love to fight and gossip. 

The algorytms which run each alligator is closely modeled after the habits of the real world reptile, Alligator Missippissus. 

Their lungs breath and thier hearts beat just like yours.

Orders for gator teeth are starting to accumulate. 

We just need your help to fund creation of the wrestling simulation. 

Our desire is to create an expierence which leaves you dripping from the feeling of utter terror and awe as you combat one of these unpredicatable beasts. 

Alligator Delivery Service in addition to gator tail, we serve realism. Hours of alligator combat video have been studied. Real life wild life wranglers have been interviewed. Now we just need to budget of 500 dollars towards the creatation of an accurate Alligator Wrestling Simulation.

And on behalf of all the artists improving Perfect Beeing.

Thank you for allowing us to serve your Alligator Fantasies

Sofware is taking over everything

We will be the last one standing

The ARTISTs become in time we all will be artists

The Human condition is to become an artist

We cant do it know be have sacracity

So people have to be responsible

Step one: Get on the Alligators Back

This is probally the most dangerous part of wrestling an alligator

Never attmp to jump an alligator from the side or from the Front

Doing so is the best way to get bit

You need to get the alligator behind you

If possible set up a distraction to the alligator has trouble focusing on you

If not possible using a cloth like a flag

Throw on top of the gators head

Make sure it covers its eyes 

A blind gator is much slower to react

The Fear METER

Run Screen 
platformer 
how far away from the animal do you wish to begin your leap
3 meters 
4 meters
4.5 meters

Aim Screen
You have ten frames of animation
Each frame is a camera shake view of running toward the alligator which is in wire frame mode
You must attempt to keep this line that runs down the alligators back straight
You must ajust the angle
Misses are culamitive
you wish to get a zero percent
rolling the finger left of right changes the angle of the straight line

the straight the line the less chance of gitting bite right off the bat

-For courners
The words randomly change
Stay Low-Go High
Extend Hands Loosely Extend Hands Firmly

Push up Quickly

With in a second select a spot on the neck to focus upon-

touch the big dot and hold and try to keep you figer on the dot as long as possible

Imagine a straight line donw the alligators head and back and tail if possible
Get a running start down that line and keep low
Leap forward with hands extended
The hands need to land on the alligator's neck
between the back of the jaws and the front two legs
when you land on the animal push down with all your might on the neck to force the head to the ground
Force the head down by pinning the head to the ground the jaws cant open
Move to the shoulders of the beast and stay high
Knees should touch th ground
Squeeze the alligator's flanks
The lower part of your legs should be pinning the hind legs to keep the feet from touching the ground
if the rear legs touch the ground the gaot can go into a death roll
you have lost control when the animal does this

once on the gator firmly you have to gain control of the mouth
Keep both hands firmly on the alligators neck pressing down with most your wieght
Their is a percentage chat -- click the down arrow to increase weight until it is a full one hundred percent
It is a precentage of strength you want to use in each location
Keeping the back legs up
Keeping the head down

Rotate you dominate hand forward
Remain in contact with the gator
Keep your strength on his side
Stay in contact with the gator
Contact is a percentage as well
Its a number that calculate the amount of skin acutally touching the alligator
Slide you hand forward down the middle of the gators head
Cover both eyes with your hand
The alligator will retract there eyes into their skulls with increased contact
Blinding the animal temporary to give your self an advatnage
Blind Percent of the Gator
Press down on the eyes with more strenght
Pin the head to the ground to prevent the jaws from opening
Slide your other hand forward and run it along the bottom jaw line
Look for soft skin around bone
Place fingers under the jaw
Move palm and thumb to the top
Grip Firmly

Allright he is moving

The slipperyniss of the mud around you can impact the success of your catch

All of an alligators jaw power is on the down stroke
the have almost no muscle power when it comes to opening the jaws
You could hold it shut with one hand- That doesnt mean you should hold it shut with one hand

The one hand covering the eyes can move down until it hooks down on the lower jaw

Both hands should now be holding the mouth shut

Lift the alligators head off the ground and toward your chest
Once the head is at a ninety degree angle the gator can no longer fight back

congratualtions you have wrestled the alligator into submission

GETTING OFF THE GATOR

push the gators head back to the ground
slide the dominant hand back into a position to cover the eyes
pushing down with the domainate hand slide your other hand back along the jaw until it is pressing against the neck

Slide your dominat=jnt hand back from the eyes to the neck
you should be in the same position you where in when you started to battle this beast

get your knees of the ground and get your feet under you
you are squatting on the gators back
keep legs tight against the body
much more difficult for the alligator to bite you when you are on its back then when you are on its side
when the animal struggles push it down again
Dont let the animal stuggle free

Grip around the neck
in one complete motion throw the alligator as far forward as you can whild you jump backwards

Depending on the size of the gator you may not be able to throw it very far

thats ok

Six inches may be all you need to throw it forward
This puts it off balance and give you more time to escape

jump back as far as you can
and keep moving backward
the gator will likely turn open its mout at you snarl or hiss
let it
Keep your eyes on it and slowly back away
if the gator chases you run away directly from it in a straight line
it will grow tired quickly and find water to return too

thats how you wrestle an alligator

i see a shillotte image of a man wrestling a gator
all the percentage sliders need to be change
take a litte bit from all when slid

The Screen Looks like the following

[Move to your Left ][JUMP][ Move to your Right ]
 
Step Two:
Get control of the Mouth
Once on the gator you must get control of the Mouth

Step Three:Submission

Step Four: Get away safely

Before chooseing a class you will want to create a character

[EXPLOSION]

You are currently carrying a mighty fine boomstick

Keep track of your energy
If your energy gets too low your going to need to find some sunlight to power it back up
Try to keep it completely full for the duration of the delivery 

Play defensively.
Chances are your are going to be entrenched in a feeling of utter terror and awe sometimes as you encounter an alligator you have neve seen before
Be incredibly cauitous
Alligators are challanging and can be difficult at first 
HOwever the more you deliver the more you will notice there tales and behavior. Remember the more deliveries you make the easier it will become
You may dread busting a gator the first time but i gurantee the second time will be less frustrating
Just take notes and pay attention
to the monsters behavior
Do research a head of time
Your are never going to find where a monsters weakest to or takes the most cutting damage 
dont be ashamed to look things up online
Real life hunters research there quarry and game before hunts to determine the best bait and equipment
Learn what elements to use on the beast
figure out the monsters area of choize to rest or respawn
Every delivery person perfers a different play style

Do you like to use flash bombs
Do you take full adavatage of traps

Dont git spot
If git spotted hide 
Repeat

The part that lets you listen to the toughts of alligators

First things first 
You are going to want to pick a boomstick to suit your delivery needs
You didnt think you would take on those gators barehanded

The question every new player asks when picking out a weap is 
which one of thise fancy weapons is best
The cream of the crop
The one to rule them all
Well.. I am going to dodge the question
let me just say this
They are all the best
yes certain weapons can dismember more than others
If used proficently
but its never enough to discourage using a weapon
certain weapons will accel on certain tasks better than others
but in the end try every weapon out
go what suits your deliery style
Use a boomstick because you have FUN using it
Not cause its supposed to do the most damage
You dont want to do too much damage
or there wont be anything left

Here we go
These are very general tutorials
They will give you a basic run down of every weapon and some advanced techniques
if you want to maximize your damage output there are many many more ways

looking at equipment can help determine what role you will play
for example a hunter with a hammer will attack the monsters head
nothing makes for poor damage than four guys tripping each other up trying to get to the monsters head
watch for upswings super pounds and GI shells
certian weapon attack can be incredibly disruptive towards other hunters
mind your positioning and make sure no other hunters are around when you are using them
contribute

grant your team wind pressure resistance or earplughs while bashing the alligators face in
dont just sit in the corner playing crummy healing songs

keep equipment up to date
when you rank up update all equipment of the approatiete rank
carry lifepoweders and dust of life to heal teammates from afar 

refer to rare catch drops to dertermine to capture or kill the alligater to retain the parts you need and run by the rest of the party
share items with your team
dont hit mounted alligators
if the alligator flinches the mount will automatically fail

Don't Place knocked out sleeping bodies next to each other 
one of them will wake up soon than the other alligator and trouble will begin
An alert status will be prompted

Tranuilized alligators dont stay down long
in fact weh have a hierarchy for the duration of how long alligators can stay out
a throw to the ground followed by a throw against a treewil leave an alligator out for fairly a short time
fther this comes the traqued sleeping alligator
Alligators choked out stay out a little longer
the longest incapation period comes from a full five hit close quarters combo
this will knock out the gator for quite sometime

a traq hit to the head gurenatees and immediate takedown

a hit to the body could take several round

firing darts in rapid succession speeds up the take down process 
Be careful with reguards to the suppressor which will break quite fast early on

on distenct advantage of the the traq. they wont report an alert status

You can attempt to wake a gator

a traqed gator has not noticed your presence

it matters a great deal wheter it is day or night

if the icon is at the top the alligator will be somewhere in the front of the screen
if the the sides or bottom the alligator is not visible on the onscreen but to the sides or behind you

There are two types of suspicions, small ones and big ones

small suspicions around an enemies attention but they will not investate your location
this type only appears momentarily
big susipicions are more serious
an aggressive gator will come after you
a passive gator will run away
A red marker will blink during this investigation
Dont take out alligators if they have communcated between each other

You can exploit alligator suspicions or intentally arouse them 
Showing yourself and ducking back allows you to frusrate and manupulate alligators that would not allow you to pass

Various other ways to diver attention or raise suspions
leaving a sleep traqed gator in the presence of another gator with attract the attention of aggressive by standers alligators

Shooting at a wall near alligators will arouse supsicions
Shooting too close triggers an alert
use magizines and decoys to draw the attention of alligator

you ll want to avoid using explosives as a distraction in general

Full Combat Mode

never shoot from out in the open
always take cover 

Combat Status appears on aggressive alligators when the spot a chariaot

When you are in the clear alligators will fall back to alert mode and then search mode

Root Cause

Imagine Choosing an Endless 
An Endless is alot like picking a pregrenerated character in a role playing game
The race class and stats are all pre picked but you still have plenty of ways to customize the avatar

An Endless starts at LEVEL one but can rise up to level 18
You can begin to master four different skill the Endless is capable of Learning
You will control this one Endless

When an endless loses Power you can start over or wait for the sun to come out

When the simulation starts 
Alligators are constantly generating alligators
Alligators are part of one of another side
WHen opposing sides met sometimes they battle it out

Each side has three powerful gods to help them out
These Enities help even things out when one side gets the upper hand

One thing has always been missing
The Alligator

An Endless can help one alligator race lead their alligators to victory by helping them destroy enemy alligators

THere are several ways for an alligator to achieve victory
Some Endless hide behind armies and destroy enemy gators forcing other Endless further and further back

Some like to absorb lots of damage

The Caster/Nuker 
these endless have powerful programs which do siginificant amounts of change
They start powerful and max out early- less powerful later on

Ranged BPS- Long Ranged heros that rely heavlily on a normal toss with skills and items to boost Wounds Per Second- These are known as Carries- weaker early on and need friends to carry them around but are stronger late and can carry the team to victory

Melee DPS- Short ranged Heroes. They are typically tougher than ranged DPS and own various mechinisms that all them to get close to the enemy to beat them up

Tank- A very tough Hero that is capaable of absorbing damage from the enemy chapions and minions so theri more fragile teammates avoid taking damage

Support- Hero who has one or two mechanisms to protect or assist others, such as a way to speed up allies or heal or prevent bad effect to them or other such buffs and protections

Disabler-Heros who have particularly good mechanisms for stopping the enemy from moving or acting. This alllows them with along with allies to beat up on the disabled gator having a much better chance of killing them

------
You can have sub events in the game
Ok TEAM A COLLECTED THE ALLIGATOR 
TEAM B NEED TO GO DO SOME PROCESSING
TEAM C NEED TO FLY THE GOOIGON DOWN TO PICK UP THE PACKAGE

TEAMWORK
a Game the ENCOURAGES Team Work

keep in mind the distiction between you endless and your champion
Each account has one Endless which is your world name
you can level this up with time from one to thirty
The Endless is persistant
Each Endless own various champions, runes, apps, mysteries and other stuff we will discuss in the future

The Delivery Champion is an entity that you play with on the battlefield for one game who always starts at zero and maxes out a 44

The delivery matching system is great
Instead of roving bands of premades to do pub stomps where they beat the living curd out of five radom noobs so they feel better about thier patheic lives
then post hier replsy and brag about them

You enter a single player queue that will match you up with ten players based on their level or stats

Practice game vs bots with your buddies

The hardcore do premades vs other premades

Go ahead and take that delivery
YOu are taken to the lobby of The Kroger Meat Market
Click Deliver at the top of the page and slect TUT
Do this to be exposed to the basics of the game

Two Types of Currency

To purchase champions, runs, and skins

G - g's are earned playing the game
G$ - are purchased using real live cash

There is also XP 
These arent spend but do determine the LEVEL of your endless

every things that can be unlocked has an G and G$ cost

Differnt Skins can be bought for 500G$

You earn G if you delivery any thing
Some games are so called G-Farming games where players beat up AI bots quickly to gain the XP
Some just practice new Champion configs against bots which can result in longer games

A delivery must last eleven minutes or more to gain any expierence
 A single Endless can only get xp for three pratice games a year once they make it to level 
fourteen

If you keep making deliveries with out quitting you get around 25 Gs per game once you are on a streak to reward non quitters

Get a massive bonus on the first delivery and can get it again 22 hours later

Buy a G booster to give out bonus Gs for four days
Which could be more cost effecitive thatn just buying something with G$ straight up if you play a lot that week and intend to suppor the game by buying g$

Once you have a ENDLess accicated with your account. it starts off with nothing unlocked or usable and at lEVEl0
As you deliver you gain XP and thus Levels

Xp gains are pretty consistant G gain vary widely

if you play one game per day and win four of them gaining bonues form the first delivery of the day quick victory, no quitting, you will earn tons more G than someone who plays seven games in one day and quits have of them
you will have the same XP more or less

You begin with nothing unlocked
There is a revolving pool of Free to Play Champions that changes every week
Because of this you do not need to spend money just to try out the various heros
However the Champion you love today may not be available tommorow when the rotation hits
There are seven Champions 
One for Each Day
They are moved downward on a que based on the day

You must make over 44 Deliveries to earn a single CHAMPION

you can gain about 70g per day on average

Sometimes you can gain secert character by tweeting out certain information

Your Endless goes get to directly intervene in the conflict by selecting two routines from a list that resemebes some the routines available for the Champion

These are used to suppliment or compliemtn your champions abilities 
They cost no sun power
Ability Power and other champion related bonuses do not apply

Some routines are dependent upon your champions level

When you level up your Endless more of these routines become available

These routines can be viewed through your Endless overview by clicking your endless picture 

Your player gets a number of talents or mastery points
In the lobby of the Kroger Meat Market click your Endless Picture next to the Shopping cart to get your Endless Overview

Click on the Mysteries Tab
You will see a talent tree
You have one point to spend
Put it into Improved Smite so you gain make more Gs
You can reset these points at any time

Everytime you gain an endless level you gain another mastery point to spend

There is nevery any reason to unse points since its free to respec as much as you want

Make sure you have mastery for what ever Champion routine you choose

RUN OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Note also the RYZE Bot is by FAR the most effective

What out

You have ninty seconds to pick stuff
First pick your Champion

if cant afford the whole thing go ahead and buy its peieces
these indivual pieces will be highlighted if you can afford them
DONT BUY DUPLICATES

BUY THE RECIPE AND COMBINE FOR YOU

There is not strenght, agility, intellengence

each champion start out with differing amounts of vaious stats and they gaing differing amounts of stats everytime they level up

so a strength based champion might have high damage to start and levefling up but a slower attack and movement speed with less juice

it is effictley the same but make things a bit simpler by skiping intermedate stats
i man strenght this pretty meanlishsess except for the end result of DAMAGE HP

Damagae how much damage you character does on a normal attack 
starts at five gains about three per level

Range more is better

Crit Chance - chance of doing double damage critcal hit. what is interesting is that several champions gain crit chance as they level up
som champs benefit more from citical hit items

Attack Speed- pretty much all champions start off at the the same level but gain dignificant boots to htere attck rate as they level
this explains that a champion that has a makexed out attack bar on ther quick stats starts out ith a fourty five damagae attck adn does progress any faster than anyone else
it usally means they got a natural big boost to their attack sppe
boosting before the xtrea is ignored to prevent gachine gun ginsu knoife ridicuslsousnesss
cap is two . five attacks per second

Ability Power is confusing
All champions have routines which deal service
Ability power boosts the damage or effect of these spells
the confusing things is that each power has an AP factor
a certain speel might gain plus eight damage for every ten 
or an big ultimate might deal fifteen for every ten
This is a prestty big semi hidden facto that can make certian champiojs speedl signigcicatnly more powerful than others
not that not champion every gets free ap as they level
this is why spellcasters typcially get weaker endgame
a level nine caster does three hundred damage say with their level nine nuke
the same caster at eighteen still does only 300
all ap gains come from runs and mysteries or oddwadds 
event with items spells will still barely keep up with the natural HP progression of most champions

Armor- Increases resitance to phyical damgage
Champions get increased armor as they level up for free
With out over complicating things armor gives around a precentage base decread in damage that deminishes per point

20 armor 16.7 percent reductin
200 armor 67 percent reduction
500 armor 83 percent reduction

logrythic scale

A bad sparkle is better than no sparkle at all

Sin Resistance
Same as Armor except again evil damage which is almost always from another champion skills and item

Hurting another Champion is a sin 

note that even physical champions such as someone who uses a boom boom stick will still usally deal SIN damge with thier skills. see the same formula for armor

Movement Speed 
There is a lot of chasing and running so this is important
Most champions have around 300 speed
Level one boots add about fifty
Some oddwads, skills, and runds, or mysteries add move speed but after a certain amoint the benefit starts to get reduced
so stacking toon of speed boosters will still maker you faster but not blazing fast

HP/MP nothing specail here but the differences between champs can be pretty high more than any other stats

HP/MP regen all champions regenerate HP and MP over time. they have a base rate of regen which can be increased. some items and skilll provide instant HP or MP recovery

Remeber you may see your favorite champion out in the swamp
Especailly if the Champion is free that week

Team Composition is slightly important
A team with 3 tanky heroes and caster really needs a ranged carry or you will be gimped in the late game

it would be nice to have a tanky character start team fights without dying imediatley

you can drop que at anytime

when you are about to go into a deliery you can see everyone is on that deilverly too while you wait

some players drop quue when they reconize a particularly bad player on their side
or because they dont like a particular type of champion
who always sucks
someone beat them to clicking there favorite character

dont quit a delivery
quitting a delivery ruins the game for everyone including you
if you personally suck your teamates might be doing just fine
tell your allies you are switching lane cuz the gator is feeding
Just ride it out
Bonus of a no Quitting Streak
Quitting will be recorded on your permanent record

AFK is the devil
On the other if you have to make wise use of it
Sometimes you have stubborn delivery mates who will not give up 
You never wish to truly go immediately AFK at the beginning of a delivery
it is the most aweful thing you can do
it hacks everyone off
if you get killed in the first thirty seconds quitting or going AFK is ridiculous
only AFK when there is no chance of the team winning not because your personal record is not looking good
Remember after everone is a level ten or so players should stick together and roam

dont feed

feeding is when you play too aggressively and get killed during the early game

the mistake the feeder mistakes is trying again but now the opponent is at a higher level

Continued failer ensure the opponent gaining resources from repeatedly killing the feeder

After twenty five minutes have elasped you can give up the delivery
you can witness a surrender vote

if you find someone who is really cool and you play well together they might invite you to be their friend
now you can make more deliveries together

you could join as premade vs solo

for every ten deliveries you try to make you are only going to win fifty percent of them
if you win alot in a row prepare to get globhammered soon

The game tries to find ten people that are close to you in the same rating
 recent deliveries boost your rating
 recent losses drop it
 Overall win loss matter
 as you get owned for a few games the matches get easier and easier
 it tries to match teams more so than players

knowing how armor 
sin resistance 
attack speed and dagamege work can really help you understand the game

learn how oddwads work
when not playing take a look at an item guide and 

click your champions icon at the bottom left corner you will see the full stats display that shows all your champions stats
these are total stats
here is where you learn your range

Its important to give the alligator a fighting chance
So we only give you the location of the alligator within an hour of the exact moment when the sacrfice was requested 
After that the alligator could be anywhere
You will be jettsoned out of a tractor heading to space
During the four mile fall you will take close care of the alligator egg in your responiblity
Since an alligator is leaving the world one must take its place
Hopefully you will land near the location you requested
If your ODDWAD cannot make safely into the farm then please attempt another delivery 
After landing, search for the mark while distrubing the other alligators as little as possible
Alligators hate stress
A stressed out alligator is an alligator that can't grow
And we all need these alligators to grow
Remember we are still attempting to grow the largest alligator in the world
The record currently stands at 14 foot 853 lbs
King George is a little short
After finding the market, take out the beast with your boomstick 
If you use the boomstick without accomplishing a kill, please destingrate your chairot and attempt another delivery
If you succeed trigger the processing process when the processing Drone Appears to processes the Order 
Googizon picks up the order for delivery
Order is delivered to the customer along with an emailed [story desribing the death of the beast]
Remember aach alligator like each story is unqiue like a snowflake
Each has been specially designed for a mystery purpose
Alligators can laugh
Alligators can love
Alligators can fight
Each one lives or dies based off the actions of the atomic world around them 
A Bounded can select any alligator on the farm for sacrfice at any time except for the following days Christmas, Thanksgiving, New Year's Day, Easter, and Sundays
Selections of sacrafice require a mailing address so the harvested totems can be delevired properly
Selections of santuartary are available all the time
Selections of santuartary allow the Healer to vote for the new alligators environment for that year
After the Savlation bar is filled the alligator is saved 
Once Santutarty has been achieved the percentage of votes relates to the percentage of time spent in each place
Don't forget on the Alligator Farm, some alligators are more to prone to being seen in some locations more than some others
Lastly, alligators love to gossip

You are wasting your time
I dont think so
I think these are good people in there heart
How did this all come to be
What I do has more to do with Literature than painting i think some times
The writer constantly revises revises and revises
Attempting to find the core 
The simplest expression of thought into code wich will in time for me will just become an image
i am not interested in just worlds
i am most interested in using worlds to create an image
Hieracrchail thinking
Why do to you get so caught up in it
Lets say ive given up on the art world
The hierachy of it
Ive given up on the art world but not on my art
What turns me on is getting the smallest line of code to turn into something complex
ive experienced total powerlessness before
i dont know if racism is the correct word
more like xenophophia
you try not to repeat yourself
every line a new line
how much of our own oppression are we responsible for 
you know who my biggest enemy in the world is 
YOU
I know you dont understand but you should start leaving me alone even more
I am campable of things far than what you can even imagine
you are so narcissticic
you want other people to play your life
what the one thing we cant do
be someone other than who we are
except through a game
i need another year
give me another year
you dont understand the creative brain
i want to play myself
i want to play my life
i want to replay the past

its so hard for me to move out of hierectical thougth
i do these things and think 
OMG they are going to love me so much
i wish that would stop
they will hate you instead

Get a bucket and pee in the bucket
im so sorry; she died; being a police officer should have not been an option

i have to an oppertunity to work on something at a more fundmental level
software mimics the brain operations 
come inside my brain
because i understand code i understand the creative process of the mind more intimately than some other artists
non linear
redunacy
character evironment viewpoint

set becomes a living embodyment of the performance
the tech allows the creative processes to resembles the way the human mind works closer than ever before

play: manipulateing somehting that doesnt show you all its possiblities and limits many of them 
fool: what else is possible and then carries out the most outlandish answer 
fun: delibetate maniulatting a familuar siutaion into a new way

respect: love something that doesnt derve it
love something that shoudnt be loved
reveals secerts
