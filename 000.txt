rules of the game 

in the beginning you notice a landscape of colors 

conferdate gray at the edges 

it influences the temporality 

there is a color to all moments 
now this color moves between 

there is a color 
and the color influecenes everything
give us a color

we wish to sell alligator products

first of all there is a currency 

how about gold scutes 

how about silver scutes 

how about bronze scutes 

and honey 

what kind of honey 
not royal 

you have blobs of data 

some of the data is related to a location

an axis 

other pieces of information symbolize fictional states of being
an avatar

some ideas churn concerning works of arte

a yet undiscovered realm of thought

so if you are finding yourself confused 

something is wrong 

and i am finding friction in the birth place

so let us return to the globratchet and see what it can do

star cruiser crash 

sigh and spin
i sure wanted it to win

it contains aLL of the will to become my tool of exploration 

when coupled with the molding dugeon that slowly bleeds me dry

the coffee wears out 

in a lake bed of mess

at least we have the code 

let us repair the birth place this morning 

as the bladder spikes the consciousness 

so yes 

the birth place will need a total fantasitical opening development

which began with the implementation of the velvet 

that had been preceded by the egg

coupled with a rising focus on the discomfort above the groin with a desire to jump into a skull door

perhaps the place of birth will calculate again today

no record shall be cocked as of now

then you reconize the value of googizon alerts 

as your once cracked ribs trouble you further 

you could organize that data in such a way to bring more value to you 

one more side project where the data comes to you instead of you running out for the data

bam 


the velvet glows 

with nothing at the moment 

but we can change that moment 

the matter of how become apparent 

first we wish to map out an image 

to do that we will need some buttons 

thor hammer build for us some buttons 

so we got the buttons 
and the we have the color map ago

we added the pyramid and prim 

to glopratchet 

now all we need is a polygon

and yes the body can add a dash 
of timecode and color code 

now we just need to spin

sigh and spin 
time to win 

alligators alligators 
something about alligators 

maybe an alligator maker

so now we have all the colors in the box 

we can also merge two colors together into a new color 

we have an average to hit in order to be a success 

now we will creating the avids and the avios 

there we be a tabbed container 

and we will drop in an image from which to build the creature 

in just seven days i will make you an 

a aa aaa aaaa aaaa ligator 

ok so that is in place 

as the mind continues to become more and more simplified 

let us log on to work 

now we can drag an image into the birth place 

the image resizes and the we pull the vibrant images out of the source 

now we just need to match the pulled out colors to the labels of colors all ready selected 
and from there we can begin to shape our alligator 

so what is our alligator shaped out of out
at the least it is made out of source

i believe we will mix all the elements together to get this value

forc-{{=it.forc}} fric-{{=it.fric}} sped-{{=it.sped}} mass-{{=it.mass}}

bein-{{=it.bein}} ctrl-{{=it.ctrl}} rslv-{{=it.rslv}} wits-{{=it.wits}}

tude-{{=it.tude}} vizn-{{=it.vizn}} post-{{=it.pstr}} styl-{{=it.styl}}

koud-{{=it.koud}} grit-{{=it.grit}} byte-{{=it.byte}} flow-{{=it.flow}}

so yeah 

you place an image into the system 
out comes a pyche 

from the pyhe you create a source 

from those you create the attributes 

from the attributes you create the body, mind, heart

from the source body heart and mind you mix to create the pattern

pay three dollars to play

the characters can now die 

and we have moved on toward the acutual creation of earth

so we need to load some data into the system

but i do get a little more exited about building another tool

to help inspire things that are not currently needed

and then we realize we need a method to filter out all the colors 

we do not really want anymore

it was my mothers kiss that turned me into a painter 

the idea that you could be the first to commit a sin 

the rich woman upset about the idea of her heart being a wicked as a commoner 

simplisity of peter witht complexitiy of paul 

16 miles from the furthers sin no you are next six feet away 

now that the axis is in and we can toggle between nations 

we wish to tike about weather 

so we look at the weather data we have and begin to filter out 

that which we do not want
