In the Everything thier only existed giants 

who spent thier time spinning dreams

The giants Boundedniss and Endlessniss 

began to spin dreams bigger and better than all the other giants.

The dreams of Boundedniss spun counter-clockwise 

while the dreams of Endlessniss spun clockwise.

The vividniss of the dreams of Boundedniss caused 

almost all the other gaints to stop spinning dreams

This was a problem for Endlessniss because she needed 

the dreams of other giants in order to continue to spin more dreams

Before she dissappeared she gathered all her past dreams together 

and spun one last dream a giant child named Cleverniss

A whisper laid at his feet 

that warned him to stay away from Hatefulniss 

but he never heard it

Cleverniss spun to life with only one need 

the need to be loved by the most beautiful thing in the Everything 
 
While walking through the Everything Cleverniss

spied Kindniss entranced with one of the dreams of Boundedniss

he wanted her attention

He wondered what she saw because he was blind to the dreams of Boundless

Then Boundedniss appeared and told him the secert

He tried many things to awake her while Boundedniss watched

SOUND

SIGHT

Combined elements into a mirrored shell 

which would refect all the light

But her she could only percieve the bright dream Boundless put before her

Ran into a gaint named sadniss 

causing the creation to absorb all light instead 

TOUCH

First, he tried creating something as beautiful as her

The five creature all had four fast legs.

They gallopped all around her loudly creating a breeze but she never noticed them so he let them go


SMELL


TASTE
Boundedniss assured him nothing he could do would work 

he might as well ask Hatefulniss for help and went away

Then Cleverniss imagined something called 

a kiss but was too afraid to try it 

When he gives up a bee flies out of his mouth

He follows it and it leads to Hatefulniss


Hatefullniss was one of the few remaining gaints 

that didnt care for anyones dreams how to snap her out of the trance

Hatefulniss had just the thing to wake her, a stinger

What Cleverniss didnt know was the Stinger 
was once a gift from Boundedniss.

Boundedniss needed the attention of Hatefulniss but he wouldnt return it.

So Boundedniss created and filled the Stinger with unwanted parts of some of his dreams

He expected Hatefullniss would eventually get some loathsome use the Stinger on himself and then Hatefulniss would be his forever

But before this could happen Hatefulniss gave the Stinger over to Cleverniss

After find Kindniss still entranced with Boundednis, Cleverniss stung her playfully with the stinger, waking her up 

She gave him one tearly look, and then dissappeared

Cleverniss could not stand being without Kindniss so he stung himself and dissappeared too

While it looked as if she dissappeared, 

she really hadnt

She just shrunk to a much smaller size

So did Cleverniss and  awoke next to Kindniss inside a dark cave

The only light came from inside them

Both assumed new forms in this place 

They both had wings where they didnt before and they could move through space

They both had a single eye where they didnt before so they could precieve time

They both had a large stinger attached to two large sacks full of a powerful creative fluid

Finally, they both had new names

FatherQueen and MotherKing

The Poison was still working on MotherKing 

so she forgot her beauty

She began to sting the FatherQueen repeatly 

The created fluid turned to posion inside hime causing him to 

forget his wits and he returned favor with stings back to the MotherQueen

The creative fluid merged with thier bodies 

and from out of the holes in bodies WadOdds and OddWads emerged

They collected themselved together and began to take on shapes

Some gather into bright Stars 

Others gather into hard Rocks

FatherQueen and MotherKing 

difted apart hating each other forming Black Holes 

in there path that could suck up all Stars and Rocks in its path

The Entities FatherQueen created to impress the MotherKing 

heard his cries and found him alone

The powers of Boundedniss made it impossible for them to communicate 

The four Spirit Animals Need

To reclaim all the ODDwadds to Grow Cleverniss

Once he is full grown he can go back in with his old awareniss and transform Kindniss
